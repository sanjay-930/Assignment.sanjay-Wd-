      <h1>Bootstrap</h1>
      <h2>01 What are the advantages of Bootstrap?</h2>
      <p>
        Bootstrap is a framework that offers many advantages for web designers
        and developers:
      </p>
      <ul>
        Other advantages of Bootstrap include:
        <li>Easy to prevent repetitions among multiple projects.</li>
        <li>Quick design of prototypes</li>
        <li>Base style</li>
        <li>Pre-styled components</li>
        <li>Support and documentation</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>02 What is a Bootstrap Container, and how does it work?</h2>
      <p>
        Containers are the most basic layout element in Bootstrap and are
        required when using our default grid system. Containers are used to
        contain, pad, and (sometimes) center the content within them. While
        containers can be nested, most layouts do not require a nested
        container.
      </p>
      <h2>03 What are the default Bootstrap text settings?</h2>
      <p>Bootstrap 4 uses a default font-size of 16px, and its line-height is 1.5. The default font-family is "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif.</p>

      <h2>04What do you know about the Bootstrap Grid System?</h2>
      <p>Bootstrap's grid system uses a series of containers, rows, and columns to layout and align content. It's built with flexbox and is fully responsive. Below is an example and an in-depth look at how the grid comes together.</p>

      <h2>05What is the difference between Bootstrap 4 and Bootstrap 5.</h2>
      <p>Bootstrap 4 has five levels: xs, sm, md, lg, and xl. Bootstrap 5 has six levels: xs, sm, md, lg, xl, and xxl. Bootstrap 4 includes jquery and all associated plug-ins. Jquery has been deleted and replaced with vanilla JS and several functional plug-ins in Bootstrap 5</p>

      <h2>06What is a Button Group, and what is the class for a basic Button Group?</h2>
      <p>“Button Groups” in Bootstrap is a class of name “btn-group” which is used to create a series of buttons in groups (without spaces) vertically or horizontally. Syntax: This is the basic syntax of the button group class where each button has its own class of “btn”.</p>

      <h2>07How can you use Bootstrap to make thumbnails?</h2>
      <p>Step 1: You need to update the anchor tag to a new div tag, which has . thumbnail as a class. </p>
      <p>Step 2: In this div tag, we can add any media or text. This div tag is used for a span-based naming convention for sizing.</p>

      <h2>08In Bootstrap 4, what is flexbox?</h2>
      <p>Bootstrap 4 now uses flexbox, instead of floats, to handle the layout</p>

      <h2>09How can one create an alert in Bootstrap?</h2>
      <p>
        Be sure you've loaded the alert plugin, or the compiled Bootstrap JavaScript.
      </p>
      <p>If you're building our JavaScript from source, it requires util.js</p>
      <p>Add a dismiss button and the .alert-dismissible class, which adds extra padding to the right of the alert and positions the .close button.</p>

      <h2>10What is a bootstrap card and how would you create one?</h2>
      <p>A basic Bootstrap card consists of a . card class with the . card-body class, allowing you to add text, images, links, and other Bootstrap elements within a rounded border.</p>
