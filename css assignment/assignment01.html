          >CSS saves time − You can write CSS once and then reuse the same sheet
          in multiple HTML pages. You can define a style for each HTML element
          and apply it to as many Web pages as you want. <br /><br />
          Easy maintenance − To make a global change, simply change the style,
          and all elements in all the web pages will be updated automatically.
          <br /><br />
          Global web standards − Now HTML attributes are being deprecated and it
          is being recommended to use CSS. So it's a good idea to start using
          CSS in all the HTML pages to make them compatible with future
          browsers.
          <br /><br />

          Platform Independence − The Script offer consistent platform
          independence and can support latest browsers as well.</b

          CSS, CSS 1 up to CSS3, result in creating of confusion among web
          browsers.
          <br />
          With CSS, what works with one browser might not always work with
          another.
          <br /><br />
          There exists a scarcity of security.
          <br /><br />
          After making the changes we need to confirm the compatibility if they
          appear.

          selectors in CSS3 has increased while CSS1 and CSS2 only had simple
